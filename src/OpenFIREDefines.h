// enable extra serial debug during run mode
//#define PRINT_VERBOSE 1
//#define DEBUG_SERIAL 1
//#define DEBUG_SERIAL 2

  // Enables input processing on the second core, if available. Currently exclusive to RP2040-based microcontrollers.
  // Isn't necessarily faster, but creates more headroom on the main core to dedicate to controlling I2C peripherals
  // while the second core exclusively handles USB input polling, serial UART (when MAMEHOOKER is defined) and force feedback processing.
  // If unsure, leave this uncommented - it only affects RP2040 anyways.
//#define DUAL_CORE // 696969 definito in platformio.ini

  // Here we define the Manufacturer Name, Device Name, and Vendor ID of the gun as will be displayed by the operating system.
  // For multiplayer, different guns need different IDs!
  // If unsure, just leave these at their defaults, as Product ID is determined by what's saved in local storage, or Player Number as a fallback.
#define MANUFACTURER_NAME "OpenFIRE"
#define DEVICE_NAME "FIRECon"  // MAX 15 char
#define DEVICE_VID 0xF143

  // Set what player this board is mapped to by default (1-4). This will change keyboard mappings appropriate for the respective player.
  // If unsure, just leave this at 1 - the mapping can be changed at runtime by sending an 'XR#' command over Serial, where # = player number
//#define PLAYER_NUMBER 1 // 696969 definito in platformio.ini

  // Leave this uncommented to enable MAMEHOOKER support, or comment out (//) to disable references to serial reading and only use it for debugging.
  // WARNING: Has a chance of making the board lock up if TinyUSB hasn't been patched to fix serial-related lockups.
  // If you're building this for RP2040, please make sure that you have NOT installed the TinyUSB library.
  // If unsure, leave uncommented - serial activity is used for configuration, and undefining this will cause errors.
//#define MAMEHOOKER // 696969 definito in platformio.ini

  // Leave this uncommented to support use of hardware switches, or comment out to disable all references to hw switch functionality.
//#define USES_SWITCHES // 696969 definito in platformio.ini

  // Leave this uncommented to support use of rumble motors, or comment out to disable any references to rumble functionality.
//#define USES_RUMBLE // 696969 definito in platformio.ini

  // Leave this uncommented to support use of solenoids for force feedback, or comment out to disable any references to solenoid functionality.
//#define USES_SOLENOID // 696969 definito in platformio.ini

    // Leave this uncommented for TMP36 temperature sensor support for solenoid tempering, or comment out to disable references to temperature reading or throttling.

  // Leave this uncommented to support use of analog sticks in analog pins.
