  // Enables input processing on the second core, if available. Currently exclusive to RP2040-based microcontrollers.
  // Isn't necessarily faster, but creates more headroom on the main core to dedicate to controlling I2C peripherals
  // while the second core exclusively handles USB input polling, serial UART (when MAMEHOOKER is defined) and force feedback processing.
  // If unsure, leave this uncommented - it only affects RP2040 anyways.

  // Here we define the Manufacturer Name, Device Name, and Vendor ID of the gun as will be displayed by the operating system.
  // For multiplayer, different guns need different IDs!
  // If unsure, just leave these at their defaults, as Product ID is determined by what's saved in local storage, or Player Number as a fallback.
  // For compatibility with some whitelists' support for OpenFIRE, Manufacturer Name and Device VID must be kept at the default values "OpenFIRE"/OxF143

  // Set what player this board is hardcoded to.
  // This will change the function of playerStartBtn/playerSelectBtn appropriate for the respective player, regardless of Product ID.
  // If unsure, just leave commented out - the mapping is adjusted dynamically based on Product ID,
  // and can be changed at runtime by sending an 'XR#' command over Serial, where # = player number.

  // WARNING: Has a chance of making the board lock up if TinyUSB hasn't been patched to fix serial-related lockups.
  // If you're building this for RP2040, please make sure that you have NOT installed the TinyUSB library.
  // If unsure, leave uncommented - serial activity is used for configuration, and undefining this will cause errors.
